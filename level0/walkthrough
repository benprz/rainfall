1. We listed the available files in the home directory
-> level0

2. We used Cutter to decompile the executable
-> We saw a condition that asked for argv[1] == 0x1a7 (423 in decimal) and that it was supposed to be atoi before

3. We also saw that there was an execve("/bin/sh") done if the above condition was met and then executed it
-> ./level0 423

4. We had an output that wouldn't allow us to do anything in the current directory, but we noticed that it was in the level0 directory and not the level1

5. So we used the fullpath to cat the .pass from the level1 home directory
-> cat /home/user/level1/.pass

su level1
